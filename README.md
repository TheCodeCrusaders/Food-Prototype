## other stuff that might to be done.
2. The electronics consist of sensors and scales that are placed inside the fridge to accurately measure the weight of its contents. These sensors are connected to the internet and send data to the website in real-time.
3. The backend server processes the data from the sensors and keeps track of changes in weight over time. It uses this information to calculate what items have been added or removed from the fridge and provides this information to the website for display to the user. Additionally, it analyzes the fridge data and suggest recipes, food expiration notifications and shopping list for the user.
